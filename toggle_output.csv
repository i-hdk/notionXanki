heuristics,    - mental shortcuts    - a simple thinking strategy that often allows us to make judgments and solve problems efficiently; usually speedier but also more error-prone than algorithms
loss aversion,        a phenomenon where a real or potential loss is perceived by individuals as psychologically or emotionally more severe than an equivalent gain    
conjunction fallacy,    - the human tendency to mistakenly assume that multiple specific conditions are more probable than a single general condition    - more unlikely to be both be bank teller and feminist than just bank teller
representativeness heuristic,    - to judge the likelihood of things in terms of how well they represent particular prototypes    - use **mental shortcut** to use when estimate probabilities    - try to assess how likely a certain event is based on an existing mental **prototype (**a mental representation of the most typical and characteristic example of a category)
availability heuristic,    - estimate the likelihood of events based on how mentally available they are    - what comes to mind quickly is deemed significant — sometimes incorrectly
sunk cost fallacy,"    - a cognitive bias that makes you feel as if you should continue pouring money, time, or effort into a situation since you’ve already “sunk” so much into it already    - “this movie stinks but i already bought the tickets so i might as well finish watching it”        - doesnt make a difference, u can get the money back    - “sunk cost” is an economic term for any past expenses that can non longer be recovered"
convergent thinking,"    - narrows the available problem solutions to determine the single best solution    - the ability to determine the single best solution    - intelligence tests, which typically demand a single correct ans, require convergent thinking"
divergent thinking,    - expands the number of possible problem solutions (creative thinking that diverges in different directions)
cognition,"        the mental activities associated with thinking, knowing, remembering, and communicating info    "
concepts,"        mental groupings of similar objects, events, ideas, and people    "
prototypes,        a mental representation of the most typical and characteristic example of a category    
schemas,"    - a concept or framework that organizes and interprets information    - a mental concept, describes patterns of thinking and behavior that people use to interpret the world    - Consider how a young child may first develop a schema for a horse. They know that a horse is large and has hair, four legs, and a tail. So, when the child encounters a cow for the first time, they might initially call it a horse. After all, the cow fits in with their schema for the characteristics of a horse"
assimilation,    - interpreting our new experiences in terms of our existing schemas    - incorporating new information into existing schemas
accommodation,    - adapting our current understandings (schemas) to incorporate new info    - modifying existing schemas or creating new ones to accommodate new information
algorithms,"    - a methodical, logical rule or procedure that guarantees solving a particular problem. contracts with the usually speedier but also more error-prone use of heuristics    - following step-by-step instructions to build a model airplane, solve a complex physics problem, or bake a cake"
insight,        a sudden realization of a problem’s solution; contrasts with strategy-based solutions    
mental set,"        a tendency to approach a problem in one particular way, often a way that has been successful in the past    "
intuition,"        an effortless, immediate, automatic feeling or thought, as contrasted with explicit, conscious reasoning    "
overconfidence,        the tendency to be more confident than correct - to overestimate the accuracy of our beliefs and judgements    
belief perseverance,        clinging to one’s initial conceptions after the basis on which they were formed has been discredited    
anchoring bias,        a cognitive bias that causes us to rely heavily on the first piece of information we are given about a topic    
gambler’s fallacy,        the mistaken belief that if an event occurred more frequently than expected in the past then it’s less likely to occur in the future (and vice versa)    
executive functions,"    - a set of cognitive skills that are needed for self-control and managing behaviors.    - **Attentional control**: This involves an individual's ability to [focus attention](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-selective-attention-2795022) and concentrate on something specific in the environment.    - **Cognitive flexibility**: Sometimes referred to as [mental flexibility](https://www.verywellmind.com/brain-exercises-to-strengthen-your-mind-2795039), this refers to the ability to switch from one mental task to another or to think about multiple things at the same time.    - **Cognitive inhibition**: This involves the ability to tune out irrelevant information.    - **Inhibitory control**: This involves the ability to inhibit impulses or desires in order to engage in more appropriate or beneficial behaviors.    - [**Working memory**](https://www.verywellmind.com/add-and-working-memory-20796): Working memory is a “temporary storage system” in the brain that holds several facts or thoughts in mind while solving a problem or performing a task."
hindsight bias,        things always seem more obvious and predictable *after* they have already happened    
creativity,        the ability to produce ideas that are both novel and valuable

flow,"    - Being immersed can be defined as a state of focus in which a person is completely absorbed and engrossed in their work    - often associated with the creative arts, such as painting, drawing, or writing.

forgetting curve,        hypothesizes the decline of memory retention in time. This curve shows how information is lost over time when there is no attempt to retain it    
active/passive learning,"        With active learning, students learn by getting involved in the information and synthesizing it through such methods as debate, experiments and other hands-on exercises. Passive learning is a more internal process in which students take in and memorize the information that is provided to them"
